# 🚀 Cloud Project Management Demo – Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the step-by-step journey of this **Cloud + DevOps Project Management Demo**.  
It documents the technical setup, project management practices, and cloud deployment lifecycle for this application.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision
To demonstrate **end-to-end Cloud Project Management** by taking a simple web application from **local development** → **source control** → **CI/CD pipeline** → **Cloud deployment on AWS ECS**.

---

## 🛠️ Phase 1 – Local Development
- [x] Set up project structure (`frontend/`, `backend/`)
- [x] Initialize Node.js project
- [x] Add basic frontend (React/HTML/CSS/JS)
- [x] Add backend service (Node/Express)
- [x] Dockerize application for containerization

---

## 🌍 Phase 2 – Version Control (GitHub)
- [x] Create GitHub repository
- [x] Push local codebase to GitHub
- [x] Add `.gitignore` for Node + Docker
- [x] Add `README.md` with project overview
- [x] Add `ROADMAP.md` (this file)

---

## 🔄 Phase 3 – CI/CD Pipeline
- [x] Create GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- [x] Install dependencies & run build
- [x] Build Docker image
- [x] Push image to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
- [ ] Auto-deploy to AWS ECS on `main` branch push

---

## ☁️ Phase 4 – Cloud Infrastructure (AWS)
- [ ] Create ECS Cluster (`cloud-demo-cluster`)
- [ ] Define ECS Task Definition for container
- [ ] Create ECS Service (`cloud-demo-service`)
- [ ] Attach Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- [ ] Configure IAM Roles & Security Groups
- [ ] Store environment variables in AWS SSM or Secrets Manager

---

## 📈 Phase 5 – Monitoring & Scaling
- [ ] Enable AWS CloudWatch logging & metrics
- [ ] Configure ECS Auto Scaling policies
- [ ] Add Health Checks for containers
- [ ] Define rollback strategy

---

## 🧪 Phase 6 – Enhancements
- [ ] Add test coverage & CI test pipeline
- [ ] Add staging environment
- [ ] Add Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform) for reproducible setup
- [ ] Document runbook for operations & recovery
- [ ] Prepare case study report for recruiters / CTOs
